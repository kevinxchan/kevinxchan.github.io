		<h2 class="title">RoutineMe</h2>
		<span><b>Technologies:</b> Android, Java</span>
		<p>
			RoutineMe is a native Android application written in Java designed to log workout routines, add timed exercises to routines, and run them using a built-in timer. It utilizes Model-View-ViewModel (MVVM) architecture for effective design, with Room Persistence Library and SQLite to store and retrieve application data. It's great for workouts where you need to constantly set and reset timers (ex: three sets of planks, each one minute, with a one minute rest in between), as this application automates it for you. RoutineMe also has automated tests, end-to-end testing and continuous integration for quality assurance.

		<h2 class="title">amphibNames</h2>
		<span><b>Technologies:</b> Node.js, Pug.js</span>
		<p>
			amphibNames is a full stack web application written in Node.js and Pug.js designed to update hundreds of historical amphibian taxonomies at once, with results temporarily saved to disk with options for the user to download. amphibNames works by querying two online databases via GET requests and parses HTML and text file responses to extract new taxonomies. With the taxonomies of amphibians constantly being updated through new research, this web application streamlines the process of updating taxa pulled from earlier literature.

  		<h2 class="title">Flights R' Us</h2>
  		<span><b>Technologies:</b> Node.js, ExpressJS, Vue.js, Sequelize.js, PostgreSQL</span>
  		<p>
  			Flights R’ Us is a flight booking web application developed by myself and three other teammates. We designed, refined and normalized E/R diagrams and database schemas for conceptual modeling, and executed our plans by creating and implementing multiple raw SQL queries for customers and staff users. Customers can login to a booking system to search for flights by different criteria, view flight and seat information, and book seats. Additionally, customers can view, update and cancel their own reservations. Through a staff account, flight information and bookings are able to be updated. Information on flight and seat data are stored in a database, and are queried through user input.

	    <h2 class="title">insightUBC</h2>
	    <span><b>Technologies:</b> TypeScript, Node.js</span>
	    <p>
	    	insightUBC is a web application written by myself and another teammate through a scrum-based, agile process over the course of 5 sprints. In this application, we developed a backend user language to query results in JSON so that users are able to view and query metadata from all of the courses offered at the University of British Columbia. This includes room locations, statistics on grades/grade distributions, and common aggregate operations (min, max, sum, etc.) similar to SQL queries. I also implemented REST endpoints for the frontend to work with, and ensured quality with unit and integration tests and by applying TDD.

	    <h2 class="title">Buses R' Us</h2>
	    <span><b>Tools/APIs:</b> Android, Java</span>
	    <p>
	    	Buses R’ Us is a mobile Android application designed to help users plan their trips via public transit accordingly. Real time data from the <a href="https://www.translink.ca/">TransLink</a> API is queried and parsed to display bus stops, bus routes, and bus arrival/departure times across the lower mainland in BC. In this project, I developed the backend models, business logic, and frontend drawables.
