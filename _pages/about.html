		Hello! I'm Kevin; a fourth year student in the combined honour's Computer Science, Microbiology, and Immunology program at the University of British Columbia. I'm interested in software development/engineering, including full stack and mobile development. I also have interests in data science, bioinformatics, and R&D in the life sciences. Click around my website to see some of my work.

		Why this major? I'm interested in bioinformatics, which lies in the intersection of the life sciences and computer science. Since I'm also interested in clinical and ecological microbiology, picking a major which integrates both was an obvious choice for me. Although bioinformatics is a broad field, my focus is on the development of bioinformatic software, which consists of traditional software development practices, with more specialization in the processing and analysis of high throughput microbial data. Currently, my research focuses on analysis of metagenomic data on microbes, but in the past, I've worked with macroscopic organisms (amphibians), and have done some wet lab work as well.

		Some of my other interests include building software to make the lives of myself and others easier, powerlifting/olympic weightlifting, music, and gaming (Portal, anyone?).
