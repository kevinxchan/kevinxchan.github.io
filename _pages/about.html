		Hello! I'm Kevin; a recent graduate from the combined honour's Computer Science, Microbiology, and Immunology program at the University of British Columbia. I'm interested in software engineering, data science, and bioinformatics. Click around my website to see some of my work.

		I started out doing research in bioinformatics, which lies in the intersection of the life sciences and computer science. During this time, I focused on analyzing environmental metagenomic data, and worked on things like genome assembly, binning, and phylogenetics. Along the way, I became more interested in the algorithms and software used for such applications; and as a result I slowly moved towards the field of software engineering. While I'm still interested in bioinformatics, I have developed other interests in cloud comptuing, web development and mobile development.

		Some of my other interests include building software to make the lives of myself and others easier, powerlifting/olympic weightlifting, music, and playing video games.
